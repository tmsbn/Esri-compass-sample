MyEsriCompassSample
===================



This sample show the implementation of a compass on ESRI world map.

Similar to the behaviour of other mapping applications such as google maps, initially the compass is invisible.
When the user tries to rotate the map, the compass appears on the top left and moves along with the rotation of the map.
Clicking on the compass will reset the map back to north direction.
After the map is reset to north, the compass will disappear after 1 second.
